Constructor: Constructor is a block of code that initialize the newly created objects.
     
      Constructor(){
      
                   //code block
                   
                   }

Constructors rules : Constructor name should be same as its class name, 
                     No return type, Should not be static,final,abstract,synchronized
                     
 Constructos Types : a) Default b) No Arguments c) Parameterized
 
 Default constructor : When we dont provide any constructor , compiler will provide default one.
                       We can not see with naked eyes, it will be in class file.
                       It will provide the default values to objects , ex: 0,null,etc...
 
 No Arguments constructors: It will allow us to write logic when object is created,
                            And This is not default constructor.
                            
 Paramerized constructor: Which means we will give parameters for constructors as below.
 
        ArgumentConstructor(String name){
        
                            //code block
        
                             }
